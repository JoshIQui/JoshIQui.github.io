    <h2>Functionality</h2>
    <p>
        This website is a search engine used to specifically find Nintendo Amiibos based on different search criteria that is presented to the user.<br>
        The user has a search box on the left side of the page that follows the screen at all times. The user can search by character name, game series,<br>
        or amiibo series. However, the user needs to be exact with their input, otherwise the API does not give results. For example, "Super Smash Bros"<br>
        will not work, but "Super Smash Bros." (with the dot) will work. The user can also select what store they are interested in buying any Amiibos<br>
        from. This option will change the link to buy each Amiibo to suit the desired store. When the search completes, the user will receive results<br>
        that contain the name, game series, Amiibo series, North American release date, and a link to buy the Amiibo for each Amiibo. The user can scroll<br>
        through their options at their leisure.

    <h2>Sources</h2>
    <p>
        For the date selector, I used the <a href="https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/">jQueryui Datepicker</a>. This site also uses the <a href="https://amiiboapi.com/">
        AmiiboAPI</a> to search for Amiibos and their information.<br>This site also uses links to <a href="amazon.com">Amazon</a>, <a href="gamestop.com">Gamestop</a>, and 
        <a href="walmart.com">Walmart</a>.

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        My final grade for this assignment would be a 90 or 95 out of 100. I did not see many errors in my project and the only issue I had with it was that I could<br>
        not get the date selector formatted. Therefore, I believe that my credit for this assignment should be high.
